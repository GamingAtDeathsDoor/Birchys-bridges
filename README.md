# Birchys-bridges
A set of beautiful bridges for use on Panthera Island for ArmA 3!
Created by [GADD]Birchy for the use on GADD Exile Panthera.

To use this, simply pack the "gadd_extras" folder into a PBO and drop it into your @ExileServer\addons\ folder.
OR if you don't use Exile, Take the .sqf and call it somewhere or find an Addons folder to drop the pbo into!


If you already have an addons PBO, you can simply call it by taking the code from the init and adding it to a current one and adding the file into a "Map content" Folder.
